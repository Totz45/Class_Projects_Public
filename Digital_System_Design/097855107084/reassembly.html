        <h3>Reassembling the Wheel Mold</h3>
        <section>
            <p>If not inserted already, insert the spring so that its outward extension is facing toward away from the mold of the mouse. Insert the wheel on the hooking end of the spring before applying pressure to the wheel to insert back into the plastic hold. For better performance of the wheel, apply pressure to the hooking end of the spring until it snaps into place inside the wheel.</p>

            </figure> 
            <h3>Reassembling the PCB mold</h3>
            <p>Reinsert the switch interface back inside the mold which helps align it to the pcb switch component. To connect the PCB back into the mold, insert both ends of the metal connecting the battery first. This ensures that the PCB is aligned with the mold. Apply pressure to both sides on the top until they snap firmly into place. When finished there should be no PCB protrusion at the top.</p>

            <p>Screw the screw back in the hole with a Philips screwdriver.</p>
            <p>At this point putting the battery at the bottom of the mouse while ensuring the metal completes the circuit and the USB is connected to the computer. Completing up until this point is the minimum to ensure a working wireless mouse.</p>

            <h3>Reassembling the M310 Wireless Mouse</h3>
            <p>Both molds can now be connected together by aligning the PCB mold and wheel mold into the slot at the top of the mouse. The image below displays the type of grip needed to acheive this. The insert requires a push-in motion to complete the connection.</p>

            <p>Before screwing the two screws back in, make sure the switch interface is set to off (slide if not). Insert the plastic tab with the battery after both screws have been screwed in. Insert the USB back into the USB slot.</p>
