            <p>Here is the M310 wireless mouse in its unopened packaging. In order to open the box, navigate to the back of the package and peel from the top where the two arrows are. Then you can unpack all of the components in the box.</p>
            <div class="image-row"> 
                <figure> 
                    <img src="Dissection/Unboxed.jpg" alt="Front of Wireless Mouse">

                </figure> 
            </div>
            <p>Flip the M310 wireless mouse over. Use one thumb to press the indentation and slide back the bottom cap away from the mouse. If the mouse is held in the orientation of the image, slide down. This reveals a battery, two screws, and USB stick.</p>
            <figure>

                <figcaption>Mouse with back cover removed</figcaption>
            </figure> 
            <p>Next, grab the USB stick and remove it using one hand. Remove the battery by pulling out the plastic tag underneath it. Remove the two screws using a Philips screwdriver that fits the size of the screw head.</p>

                <figcaption>Using two fingers in a pinching mechanism makes the removal process easier</figcaption>
            </figure> 
            <p>Lift the back of the mouse, near the Logitech logo, up and out while holding the front down. This exposes the mouse into two separate molds. For the rest of the dissection the PCB mold refers to the right image and the Wheel mold refers to the left image.</p>
            <div class="image-row">

            <h3>Wheel Mold</h3>
            <figure> 
                <img src="Dissection/Disassembly/wheel_mold.jpg" alt="Wheel Mold">
                <figcaption>The Wireless Mouse mold containing the scroll wheel</figcaption> 
            </figure> 
            <p>Dissecting the Wheel mold further, use a flathead screwdriver with a screw head smaller than the Philips to push against the plastic holding the center of the wheel in place while also using a finger to push against the spring. The wheel will fall out if the mold is turned upside down. The spring slides off after the wheel is removed.</p>

                <figcaption>The wheel mold after the wheel is successfully removed.</figcaption>

            <h3>PCB Mold</h3>
            <figure> 
                <img src="Dissection/Disassembly/pcb_mold.jpg" alt="PCB mold">
                <figcaption>The Wireless Mouse mold containing the printed circuit board (PCB) and battery</figcaption>
            </figure> 
            <p>Moving on to the PCB, remove the screws holding the PCB in place. Remove the positive end of the metal connecting the battery to the PCB by pulling the metal out of the plastic casing. This step is required in making the PCB removal easier. The other end of the metal, with the swirl should not be removed, instead, use either a flathead screwdriver or careful lifting to lift the PCB on the bottom sides closest to the battery holding. This should remove the PCB from the mold.</p>

            <p>Displayed below is the front and back of the PCB</p>

            </figure> 
            <p>Finally flip the mouse so that the on/off switch interface falls out. The PCB mold should be nothing but plastic.</p>
