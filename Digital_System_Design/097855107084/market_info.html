        <h2>About Logitech</h2>
        <p>Founded in 1981 in Lausanne, Switzerland, Logitech started connecting people through innovative computer peripherals and many industry firsts, including the infrared cordless mouse, the thumb-operated trackball, the laser mouse, and more. The swiss company expanded into Silicon Valley later that decade.</p>

            <h3>History of the M310 and the Masters series computer mouses</h3>
            <p>This Computer Mouse is apart of the Master series line of computer mouses brought about by Logitech. The first Mouse in the series was the M100 Corded Mouse. This mouse required a direct connection to the computer's usb drive. The wireless mouses came next with the M170 and M185. These computer mouses behaved similarly to the M310 but lacked the complex ergonomic design.</p>
            <p>The next in line came the silent series with the M220 Wireless mouse and the M240 bluetooth mouse. The appeal for these products is the minimal amount of noise the product creates from its electrical components. That brings the history of the Logitech Master Series up to the M310 which introduced complex ergonomic design and contributions fro hand compatibility.</p>
            <p>After the M310 is the M500 series featuring 2-3 more buttons on the mouse than previous designs, and specific right and left hand support. Finally there is the M700 series which integrates artificial intelligence onto the computer mouse.</p>
