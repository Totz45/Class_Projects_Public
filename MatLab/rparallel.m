% Write a function named rparallel which computes the equivalent 
% resistance and power rating for a network consisting of resistors 
% connected in parallel. The function arguments are two row or 
% column vectors (they should be of equal length, lengthâ‰¥1), the 
% first containing resistance values and the second containing 
% corresponding power ratings. The function returns two values, 
% equivalent resistance and power rating. Check for errors in the 
% function arguments (use assert statements). Use a anonymous 
% function to compute the equivalent resistance of resistors 
% in parallel in this function.
