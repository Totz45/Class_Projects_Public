Adder - Used to increment to next instruction.

ALU - operand definitions.

ALU_mux - mux connected to the second operand of the ALU.

AND_gate - used and generated for each register in the register unit.

Comp_Design_Project.qsf - contains information regarding the board used, testbench and simulation. DON'T delete.

Computer - top-most entity of the project.

Instr_mux - used to differentiate R-type instructions from other types of instruction formats in MIPs connected to the write register input of reg_unit. 

Mem (cmp, qip, inst) - generated by quartus. Instruction Memory block.

ReadUnit - inside the register unit, implements read functionality for the registers.

Reg_unit - stands for register unit, encompasses read and write units for the registers.

reg_unit_registers - register definition located inside reg_unit.

register_decode - decoder for the read unit.

register_mux - mux for the write unit inside the reg unit.

register_package - used as a library so that the read unit and write unit can use the registers and the corresponding data in them between each other.

regn - denoted as the program counter (PC)

sign_extend - extends the 16-bit address to 32 bits by cloning the MSB.

testbench - VHDL file used to simulate waveforms in modelsim. Use RTL simulation to get to modelsim using the testbench after compilation.

write unit - inside reg unit, implements write functionality for the registers inside.

Waveform folder - simulated waveforms as pictures for viewing pleasure

READ ME - self-explanatory.
