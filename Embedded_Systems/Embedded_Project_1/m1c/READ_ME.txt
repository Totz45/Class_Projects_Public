It is best practice to hold SW_2-SW_5 down because these switches drive the rows needed to compute the 4-bit hexadecimal code sent to the serial output. The columns are driven by the keypad as specified by the schematic.

The code sends serial output after each delay. The implementation of m1b should remain unchanged.
