This program is a press mechanism reflect the state of the switches pressed on the board. For example when switch 2 is pressed, the state of the LED3-LED0 is determined by the row of *,0,#, and D reflecting the layout of the Edubase_Pico schematic. The reason that the implementation was done this way was to fix an implementation issue whereas if multiple switches were pressed, the state would reflect on the row with the highest priority (SW_5 would activate row 0, based on schematic and row 3, on design. 

The initial state of the board alternates the flashing between the pico led and all four edubase leds. This state is also achieve if no SWs or two or more SWs are pressed. A gagfly implementation of the program was coded because a hardware issue of the gpio remaining high after pull down causes interrupts or implementations of while loops in code to be invalid for implementation. This is due to needed to reset the pins manually after each read, defeating the purpose of interrupts. 

The press and release specification from the problem is also affected by the implementation and hardware issue causing the implementation of this mechanism to be impossible on the raspberry pi pico 2.
